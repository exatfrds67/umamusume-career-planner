        L4["Risk: Browser cache clear"]
    end
    
    subgraph Account["🟣 Account Mode"]

        A3["Access anywhere"]

### 5.2 Issue Solutions

| **"Connection Lost"** | Internet dropped while editing Account plan | App enters Offline Mode. Changes saved as "Draft" on device. When internet returns, you'll be asked to save the draft |
| **Missing Local Data** | Different browser or cleared cache | Ensure you're using the same browser. Incognito mode deletes data when closed |
| **Skill Not Found** | Name mismatch | Try typing part of the Japanese name if the English name isn't working |
| **Stats Not Saving** | Form not submitted | Make sure to click "Save" after making changes |
| **Slow Performance** | Too many plans | Archive old completed plans to improve loading speed |

### 5.3 Offline Mode

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Online: Normal operation
    Online --> Offline: Connection lost
    Offline --> DraftSaved: Auto-save draft
    DraftSaved --> Offline: Continue editing
    Offline --> Online: Connection restored
    Online --> SyncPrompt: Draft detected
    SyncPrompt --> Online: Save draft
    SyncPrompt --> Online: Discard draft
```

When your internet connection drops:

1. The app automatically enters **Offline Mode**
2. Your changes are saved as a **Draft** in your browser

# D01 - System Development Plan

## Uma Musume Career Planner

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Status:** Active

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This System Development Plan outlines the approach for consolidating five legacy Uma Musume tracking
applications into a unified, feature-rich platform called the **Uma Musume Career Planner**. The
system enables players of Uma Musume: Pretty Derby to track, manage, and analyze their career
progression through a modern web application built on Laravel 12+, Livewire 3, Alpine.js, and
TailwindCSS v4.

### 1.1 Project Objectives

- Consolidate features from six application versions into a single platform
- Implement dual storage modes (Local/Account) for flexible user experience
- Achieve WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Deliver a responsive, mobile-first design with dark mode support
- Provide comprehensive data import/export capabilities

### 1.2 Source Applications

| Application | Stack | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| uma_musume_race_planner | PHP + MySQL + Bootstrap | Most feature-complete |
| umamusume-tracker | Laravel 12 + React | Best API design |
| uma-tracker | Laravel 11 + Blade | Closest to target stack |
| uma-run-tracker | Static HTML + JS | Best accessibility |
| uma-tracker-form | Native PHP + MVC | Simplest implementation |
| uma-musume-planner-laravel | Laravel | Target repository |

## 8. Risk Management

### 8.1 Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| localStorage quota limits | Medium | High | Implement quota warnings, plan IndexedDB migration |
| Legacy data incompatibility | Medium | Medium | Version exports, implement migration adapters |
| Accessibility regression | Low | High | Automated axe-core tests in CI |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Lazy loading, virtualization for large lists |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Low | Target modern browsers, progressive enhancement |

### 8.2 Risk Matrix (Mermaid)

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Risk Assessment Matrix
    x-axis Low Probability --> High Probability
    y-axis Low Impact --> High Impact
    quadrant-1 Monitor
    quadrant-2 Critical
    quadrant-3 Low Priority
    quadrant-4 Moderate
    localStorage quota: [0.5, 0.8]
    Legacy data: [0.5, 0.5]
    Accessibility: [0.2, 0.8]
    Performance: [0.3, 0.5]
    Browser compat: [0.2, 0.3]
```text

### 8.3 Contingency Plans

1. **Storage Migration**: If localStorage proves insufficient, accelerate IndexedDB migration
2. **Data Import Failures**: Provide manual data entry as fallback
3. **Performance Issues**: Implement server-side pagination earlier than planned

## 9. Quality Assurance

### 9.1 Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Tool | Coverage Target |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Unit Tests | Pest | 90%+ |
| Feature Tests | Pest | 80%+ |
| E2E Tests | Playwright | Critical paths 100% |
| Accessibility | axe-core | WCAG AA 100% |
| Visual Regression | Playwright | Key pages |

### 9.2 Critical User Flows

1. Create character → upload image → save
2. Create run via quick create → add stat turns → chart renders
3. Add skill via autocomplete → keyboard navigate → set status + turn acquired
4. Export Excel/CSV/Markdown with preview
5. Import JSON → preview → confirm → verify data
6. Dark mode toggle → refresh → persists
7. Convert local run to account after login

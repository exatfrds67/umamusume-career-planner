- **Testing**: Pest v3 with PHPUnit v11
- **Code Quality**: Laravel Pint v1
- **Requirements**: 59 total requirements, 15+ database tables, 80%+ test coverage
- **Timeline**: 22-28 weeks development (6 phases)
- **Document Numbering**: 000-010, 017 (011-016 reserved/unused)

## Solutions Repository

## Service Worker Caching Issue

- **Problem**: Navigation to dashboard was redirected/cached, requiring hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) due to missing or misconfigured service worker, especially aggressive in Chrome
- **Root Cause**: Service worker was being registered in the app but `public/sw.js` didn't exist, causing 404 errors and browser caching issues. Chrome was caching old broken service workers.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Created `public/sw.js` with network-first strategy for navigation requests
  2. Added automatic old service worker cleanup in `resources/js/app.js`
  3. Created `SetCacheHeaders` middleware to prevent HTML page caching
  4. Added `updateViaCache: "none"` to service worker registration
- **Files Modified**: 
  - Created: `public/sw.js`, `app/Http/Middleware/SetCacheHeaders.php`
  - Modified: `resources/js/app.js`, `bootstrap/app.php`
- **Strategy**: Network-first for HTML (always fresh when online), cache-first for static assets (images, fonts), automatic cache cleanup, no-cache headers for HTML
- **Result**: On next page load, all old service workers are unregistered, caches cleared, and fresh service worker installed

## Alpine.js Script Timing Issue

- **Problem**: Profile page failed to load because `profileManager()` Alpine.js function was defined inside `@section('content')`, making it unavailable when Alpine.js tried to initialize `x-data="profileManager()"` on line 6
- **Solution**: Move the `<script>` tag from inside `@section('content')` to use `@push('scripts')` so it executes after Alpine.js loads
- **File Fixed**: [resources/views/profile/show.blade.php](resources/views/profile/show.blade.php)
- **Result**: Profile page now loads correctly, all 18 profile tests pass

## Documentation Consistency

- **Problem**: Mixed date formats and inconsistent cross-references across documentation
- **Solution**: Standardize all dates to "Month DD, YYYY" format, add cross-references between planning documents
- **Result**: Achieved 10/10 (100%) documentation consistency

## Product Requirement Documents

- **Problem**: PRD folder missing from docs
- **Solution**: Recreated docs/prds with PRD-001..007 (module-level product requirements) and added to 000_DOCUMENT_INDEX with dependency links
- **Result**: PRDs visible in docs/prds and referenced in catalog/dependency matrix

## API Verification Status

- **Problem**: Inconsistent terminology for API verification status
- **Solution**: Standardize to "verification pending" for unverified APIs, "verified active" with date for verified
- **Avoid**: Don't use "requires verification" - use "verification pending" instead

## Requirements Count Standardization

- **Problem**: Diagram documentation referenced "60 comprehensive requirements" or "48 requirements" inconsistently
- **Solution**: Standardized all documentation to reference "59 requirements" consistently
- **Files Updated**: data-flow-diagram.md, decision-tree-flow-diagrams.md, entity-relationship-diagram.md, system-process-flow-diagrams.md, user-workflow-diagrams.md
- **Result**: All diagram documentation now aligned with main system documentation
